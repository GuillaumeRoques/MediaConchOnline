# MediaConchOnline README

MediaConch is an open source software project consisting of a toolset that aims to further develop the standardization and validation of preservation-level audiovisual files used within various memory institutions and communities. The software consists of an implementation checker, policy checker, reporter and fixer that will work together to offer its users an advanced level of ability to validate, assess and find solutions to repair the digital files within their collections. Accessible via either the command line, a graphical user interface (GUI), or web-based shell, the MediaConch project will serve to provide detailed individual and batch-level conformance checking analysis using its adaptable, flexible and interoperable software application interface. With a project focus dedicated to furthering the longevity of Matroska, Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) and FF Video Codec 1 (FFV1) as recommended digital preservation audiovisual formats, MediaConch will anticipate and contribute to the further development of the standardization of these formats. The MediaConch open source project was created and is currently under development by MediaArea, notable for the creation of MediaInfo, an open source media checker software application.

MediaConchOnline is a web application for MediaConch.
